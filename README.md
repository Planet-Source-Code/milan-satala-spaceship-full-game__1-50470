### Description

You controll a spaceship. You fight against a large ammount of enemies. Game is not a tutorial or something like that (source is not commented) so you won't learn anything. Becouse of this I had a free hand creating it so it is quite funny. However I spent just one weekend working on it so it doesn't have many levels and you should be able to finish it in less than hour. I used the engine from my older game Lander (also here on PSC). Have fun !

PS: Don't forget to read readme.txt becouse the game is quite complex and you might have problems playing it.
