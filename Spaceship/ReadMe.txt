As you can see you are limited by fuel. You can refuel at landing zones. 'Traffic light' at the landing zone indicates whether you can land or not. You can land only if you killed all the enemies who were standing to the left of the landing zone.
Sometimes a text appears: Radar scan !!! A number under this text indicates how much time you have before you are targeted and a rocket is lunched at you. You can't evade it and it will destroy 50% of your shield. You can avoid this by hiding under the line that appeared. It indicates where radar can reach.
... well, and thats all.
